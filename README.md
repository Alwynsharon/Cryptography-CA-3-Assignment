# Features :

DES Encryption: Encrypt any text or message using a secure 8-character (64-bit) key.

DES Decryption: Decrypt DES-encrypted ciphertext back to its original plaintext form.

Interactive UI: A futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired user interface with glowing effects and custom fonts.

Fully Responsive: The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

Real-time Feedback: Instant notifications for successful operations, errors, or copied text.
